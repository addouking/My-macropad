# My-macropad
<h1>Worked together on the models with @Yusufumben08, made the models in fusion360 and made the render in blender, uploading here for my own macropad.</h1>

first electronics project. I found this last second so i couldnt do much more than this because of the time constraint. Made in 5~ hours.
